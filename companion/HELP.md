## When using more than one PTZ camera

**When Configuring** more than one instance, please make sure you have **"AUTO TCP"** enabled or change the **TCP** port accordingly, this is a port used in companion, and you will not find a setting for it on the cameras. The TCP port **NEEDS** to be unique for each PTZ instance you add. It's strongly recomended to leave **"Auto TCP"** turned on.
